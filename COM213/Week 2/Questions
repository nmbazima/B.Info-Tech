b) Prompt the user to enter an integer. End your prompting message with a colon (:) followed
by a space and leave the cursor positioned after the space.

c) Read an integer from the keyboard and store the value entered in integer variable a.

d) If number is not equal to 7, print "The variable number is not equal to 7."

e) Print the message "This is a C program." on one line.

f) Print the message "This is a C program." on two lines so that the first line ends with C.

g) Print the message "This is a C program." with each word on a separate line.

h) Print the message "This is a C program." with the words separated by tabs.

2.4 Write a statement (or comment) to accomplish each of the following:

a) State that a program will calculate the product of three integers.

b) Define the variables x, y, z and result to be of type int.

c) Prompt the user to enter three integers.

d) Read three integers from the keyboard and store them in the variables x, y and z.

e) Compute the product of the three integers contained in variables x, y and z, and assign
the result to the variable result.

f) Print "The product is" followed by the value of the integer variable result.

2.5 Using the statements you wrote in Exercise 2.4, write a complete program that calculates
the product of three integers.

2.6 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following statements:

a) printf( "The value is %d\n", &number );

b) scanf( "%d%d", &number1, number2 );

c) if ( c < 7 );{

}
d) if ( c => 7 ) {
printf( "C is equal to or less than 7\n" );
}

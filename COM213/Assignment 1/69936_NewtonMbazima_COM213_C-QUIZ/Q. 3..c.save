// /*The comments below list three types of Repletion or Loop statements used in C*/
//
//A for statement
//A while statement
//A do-while statement
//
//
//The for loop is started with the keyword for . There are three expressions which appear with in a for loop.
//
//Initializing Expression
//Test Expression
//Increment Expression
//It has the following standard form.
//
//for (int i = 0; i <= min; i++)
//   ans += i;
//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//The while loop continues until the specified condition is true. The general form of while loop is
//
//while(condition)
//   loop statement
//
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//The do-while loop is similar to the while loop in that the loop continues as long as the specified loop condition remains true.
//The main difference is that the condition is checked at the end of the do-while statement. So do-while loop is
//always executed at least once. The general form is
//
//do{
//   //loop statement
//} while(condition)
//
